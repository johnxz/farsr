This R package was built as an assignment for the Coursera course
“Building R Packages”.

It provides R functions that can be used to import, summarize and
visualize ‘yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor
vehicle traffic crashes’ that has been annually published by and
publicly available for download from the Fatality Analysis Reporting
System (FARS), which is a nationwide census of US National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
