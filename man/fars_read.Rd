\description{
`fars_read()` is a helper function used by `fars_read_years()` and `fars_map_state()`,
which reads in an annual FARS data file. The file is supposedly the query output from
the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting
System, exported into a .csv file and compressed in the bz2 format.
